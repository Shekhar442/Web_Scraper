# Selenium Web Scraper

This Python script demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver with BeautifulSoup to scrape dynamic content from a web page.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- BeautifulSoup4
- ChromeDriver

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```

2. Download ChromeDriver:
   - Visit the [ChromeDriver downloads page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
   - Download the version that matches your Chrome browser version
   - Extract the executable and place it in a known location on your system

## Usage

1. Update the `driver_path` variable in the script with the path to your ChromeDriver executable:

```python
driver_path = "path/to/chromedriver"
```

2. Run the script:

```
python scraper.py
```

The script will:
- Open a Chrome browser
- Navigate to the specified URL
- Extract the page source after JavaScript has rendered the content
- Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup
- Print the text content of all `<p>` elements found on the page
- Close the browser

## Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change the target URL
- Extract different elements or attributes
- Perform additional actions on the page before scraping

I've created a README file for your Selenium web scraping script. This README provides an overview of the script, explains the prerequisites, installation steps, usage instructions, and offers some customization tips.

You can save this content as a `README.md` file in the same directory as your script. This will help others (or yourself in the future) understand how to set up and use the script.

Is there anything you'd like to add or modify in this README?
